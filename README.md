STEP 4: TAKE DEPENDENCIES YOU WANT

a) **LAMBOK** :-Lombok is a Java library that provides annotations to simplify Java development by automating the generation of boilerplate code. Key features include automatic generation of getters, setters, equals, hashCode, and toString methods, as well as a facility for automatic resource management.

b) MYSQL DRIVER :-
c) SPRING BOOT DEVTOOLS :- The Spring boot dev tools module includes many useful developer features for improving the development experience, such as static resource caching, **automatic restarts**, **live reload**, global settings, and remote application running .

d) SPRING DATA JPA :- Spring Data JPA focuses on using JPA to store data in a relational database. Its most compelling feature is the ability to create repository implementations automatically, at runtime, from a repository interface.

e) SPRING WEB :-

In a CRUD API project that utilizes RESTful principles, the **spring-boot-starter-web** dependency serves as the foundation for building RESTful web services using Spring Boot. Here's how the dependency is typically used:

**REST Controllers**: The spring-boot-starter-web dependency includes Spring MVC, which allows you to define REST controllers. These controllers handle incoming HTTP requests, map them to appropriate methods, and return HTTP responses, typically in JSON or XML format.

**Request Mapping**: With Spring MVC, you can use annotations like @RestController and @RequestMapping to define the endpoints of your REST API. These annotations help you map HTTP requests to specific methods in your controllers.

**HTTP Methods**: Spring MVC supports various HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. You can use annotations like @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, and @DeleteMapping to specify which HTTP methods your controller methods handle.

**Request and Response Handling**: Spring MVC provides abstractions for handling HTTP request parameters, headers, and bodies. It also supports content negotiation to automatically convert Java objects to JSON or XML responses based on the request's Accept header.

**Validation**: You can use Spring's validation framework to validate request data using annotations like @Valid and @Validated. This ensures that incoming data meets certain criteria before processing.

**Exception Handling**: Spring MVC provides robust support for handling exceptions thrown during request processing. You can define exception handler methods in your controllers or use global exception handlers to handle specific types of exceptions.

Overall, the spring-boot-starter-web dependency provides everything you need to build a RESTful CRUD API with Spring Boot, from defining endpoints to handling requests and responses, to integrating with other Spring modules for advanced functionality.


f) SPRING WEB SERVICES :- Spring Web Services (spring-boot-starter-web-services): This dependency is specifically for building SOAP-based web services in Spring Boot applications. It includes tools for creating and consuming SOAP endpoints, handling SOAP messages, and generating WSDL files.



g) Thymleaf :-  Thymeleaf is a template generator. HTML pages are generated by Spring on the backend server. All changes on the page need to call the backend, generate a new page and refresh the user's page.
